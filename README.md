Charge by Christian KÃ¤ser
=========================

Charge is a small physics based game for two (later more) players in
which every object may have an electric charge. Positive charge is
symbolized by a red light, negative charge by a blue light. Your goal is
to push the other player off the platform by inverting your token's
charge at the right moment.

There are three kinds of objects:
* Player's token: large black object with claws and player color markers
* Movable obstacle: flat dish
* Fixed obstacle: flat disk with claws

It is highly recommended to play this at native resolution. Otherwise
it might be hard to see details such as the player colors. This will
change as soon as I have time to create better textures.
